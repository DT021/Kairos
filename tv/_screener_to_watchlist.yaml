    # Depending on how large the result set of the screener is you may want to set this delay higher (or lower). It's a
    # good idea to test run this yourself. Hit page down as many times as is necessary to see it start loading and
    # measure the time it takes to load the next 150 results. As the table grows it will increasingly be slower. So,
    # make sure to scroll down to the end of the list to get a good idea of just how slow the scroll down can be.
